FewellArticle Title: Journal: Medical PhysicsIssue Date: December 1997, Volume 24, Issue 12DEPOSIT INFORMATIONDescription: Supplementary Material Total No. of Files: 9Filenames:   header           mainprog.c         mainprog.exe     mamspec.c          moly.h           part.008         readme.txt         rhodium.h         tungsten.h      Filetypes: Ascii, .exeSpecial Instructions:This file describes the code associated with MAMSPEC.C, a "C" language subroutine which calculates realistic x-ray spectra for molybdenun, rhodium, and tungsten anode x-ray tubes between 18 and 42 kV.  The spectra that are produced do NOT include any added filtration - the only filtration of the spectra are by the (approximately) 0.5 mm Be window of the x-ray tube, and any self filtration by the anode itself.To compile the subroutine, you'll need three data files (included in this EPAPS directory):MOLY.HRHODIUM.HTUNGSTEN.HComplete instructions for using MAMSPEC.c are given in the file itself as a header.  Also included in this EPAPS directory is a calling program, MAINPROG.c, which calls MAMSPEC.c and calculates a series of mammography x-ray spectrum and stores them in ASCII files with self evident names.A run time program MAINPROG.EXE is also included which runs under DOS on a PC, and this code actually generates the spectral data files.  If your machine runs emulated DOS (e.g. NT 4.0), this program may not work.These files are presented in a form most conducive to understanding, and are not optimized for speed or memory usage.  Good luck.Author Contact Information:John M.
